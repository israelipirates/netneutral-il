{"name":"net-neutral IL","tagline":"If you care about internet freedom in Israel, help us build netneutral.org.il","body":"We care about an open and free internet, with censorship.\r\n\r\nA law is about to be passed that introduces official internet cencorship in Israel, at the discression of each and every police officer. Not judge. Not law-maker. **Police officer**.\r\n\r\nWe believe this is wrong. While some websites might need blocking, it is far too problematic handing over the authority to do this to police officers, which are supposed to be the **executors** of the law (רשות מבצעת).\r\n\r\n[SOPA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stop_Online_Piracy_Act) protests succeeded because the world united against SOPA. Israel is smaller, but the concentration of amazing, creative, freedom-loving people is very high. Together, we can stop this.\r\n\r\n### How can YOU help?\r\n1. Head over to [This thread](https://www.facebook.com/groups/israelipirates/permalink/174209676098980/), and help us with creative ideas on how to resist.\r\n2. **Improve this website!**. If you have some technical or design background, there's a lot to do. If you have influence with the media. If you manage, or just work at, an internet startup with people who love our freedom. (Anyone can pick a task and do something)[https://github.com/isareli-pirates/netneutral-il/issues].\r\n3. Spread the word. Don't just share on Facebook, write a sentence or two along with that share, to get your personal message across.\r\n\r\nTogether we stand, divided we fall.","google":"UA-3992244-14","note":"Don't delete this file!
